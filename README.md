Title: Driving Forces - Key Factors that drive car sales and pricing. 
I learned about creating and managing Python virtual environments, developing a web application, and deploying it to a publically accessible cloud service.
Prerequisites: I worked in VS Code, setting the Python interpreter to match the virtual environment. I created a GitHub account and initialized a new repository with README.md and .gitignore files. I also installed necessary packages including pandas, streamlit, and plotly-express. Additionally, I also created a Render.com account and linked it to GitHub.
Using the given car advertisement dataset (vehicles_us.csv), I performed Exploratory Data Analysis, by createing an EDA.ipynb Jupyter notebook where I also created histograms and scatterplots to better explain my EDA. 
The next step was to create an app.py file in the root directory of the project where I imported necessary modules like streamlit, pandas, and plotly_express, loaded the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame. I then incorporated various streamlit components into the app like headers, histograms, scatter plots, and checkboxes.
This updated README file includes a basic project description and instructions for other users to run the project on their local machine.
I added a streamlit configuration file to the GitHub repository.
I created a new web service linked to the GitHub repository in Render.
I configured the Render web service to install necessary packages and run the app.py file.
I deployed the final version of the application on Render.
